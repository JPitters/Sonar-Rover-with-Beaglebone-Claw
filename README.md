# Sonar-Rover-with-Beaglebone-Claw
This is a program that I worked on around May 2018, where the user is able to operate a rover and it's claw with wireless transactions. The code is multi-threaded to allow the rover to return information read from the sonar sensor that determines the distance from an object, while the user sends command to the rover.
